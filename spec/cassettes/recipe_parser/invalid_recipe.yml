        the following text and parse it into a JSON recipe object.\nThe recipe object
        should have the following attributes:\n- title\n- description\n- ingredients,

        description on how to complete the instruction (e.g. \"Preheat the oven to
        350 degrees Fahrenheit\")\n-- an instruction (string): a short sentence thath
        summarizes the step in 45 characters or less (e.g. \"Preheat the oven\")\n---

        separate recipe_steps.\nTypically this is identified by the word \"and\" or
        a comma between two actions (verbs).\nAlso if instructions are given in a
        paragraph separated by periods, please split them into separate recipe_steps.\n\n"},{"role":"system","content":"If

        stretch of coastline in southern Italy, known for its picturesque landscapes,
        charming villages, and rich history. The story of Amalfi dates back to ancient
        times when it was a major maritime power.\n\nAmalfi was a maritime republic
        in the Middle Ages, gaining prominence in the 9th century. It was a key player
        in Mediterranean trade, with a powerful navy and a prosperous economy. The
        town of Amalfi itself was a bustling hub of commerce, known for its shipyards
        and trading activities.\n\nOne of the most significant contributions of Amalfi
        was the creation of the Amalfi Maritime Code, a set of maritime laws that
        became influential in the Mediterranean trade network. These laws helped regulate
        and standardize maritime trade practices, contributing to the region''s economic
        success.\n\nThe decline of Amalfi''s maritime influence began in the 12th
        century due to various factors, including Norman invasions and changes in
        trade routes. Despite this decline, the Amalfi Coast continued to be a place
        of cultural and artistic significance.\n\nToday, Amalfi and the surrounding
        coastal towns, including Positano and Ravello, attract visitors from around
        the world with their beautiful landscapes, historical sites, and delicious
        cuisine. The region has retained its charm and allure, making it a popular
        destination for tourists seeking a mix of history, culture, and natural beauty."}],"temperature":0.5}'
